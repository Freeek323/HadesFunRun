~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ v1.1

Updates
- Can choose to play a multi weapon run, where all randomisers stay the same but # infernal arms are listed.
- Rule randomiser, where you have to play it in a specific way (like dash only, etc)
- Automated removal of mirror of night selections if Routine Inspection heat is selected.
- 'Game choice' menu when loading the program, as well as a quick start selections
- If Routine Inspection is chosen by the randomiser, the mirror of night in the result screen will hide the options you don't need to change, and even have a small message (can see it in the screenshot above).
- The Pacts of Punishment are in order to the game, and if one isn't selected it shows the blank space, making it much easier visually to match your game too it.
- The 'enter to run randomiser again' is instantaneous with the exact settings you've already selected.
- Multi weapon works too. If you choose not to play with a specific weapon, you'll get the option to ask how long you want the multi-weapon run to be.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   v1.0

Currently randomised things- 
- Mirror of Night,  Infernal Arm and aspect, companions, keepsakes on a per floor basis, heat level.

Input customisation
- you can toggle if you want to use heat.
-if heat is enabled you can choose a maximum and minimum heat level.
- you can limit the infernal arm randomisation to be just about a single weapon (eg; you want to play with coronacht, but the aspect is still randomised).
- you can enable/disable the starting keepsake (for Tartarus) to be one of the god keepsakes so that everyone starts with the same boon-type. 

Current QOL measures
- the chosen abilities in the Mirror of Night will display as their green/red states like in the game, making the selection much easier.
- Fail-safes if you miss type in any field
- Quick restart with the same settings
